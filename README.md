**Phase 1 Report: Project Definition and Design Thinking** 

**Project Definition:** 

The project's overarching goal is to revolutionize public transportation by integrating IoT (Internet of Things) sensors into vehicles. This integration will enable the continuous monitoring of ridership, real-time tracking of vehicle locations, and the prediction of arrival times. Through these efforts, the project intends to provide the public with access to real-time transit information, thus significantly enhancing the efficiency and quality of public transportation services. In Phase 1, we have accomplished the following key tasks: 

1. **Objective Definition**: Clear and specific project objectives have been established. These objectives include real-time parking space monitoring, seamless integration with a mobile app, and the creation of an efficient parking guidance system. 
1. **IoT Sensor Design:** The project has outlined a comprehensive plan for designing and deploying IoT sensors within public transportation vehicles. These sensors will be strategically positioned to detect and relay information regarding parking space occupancy and availability. 
1. **Real-Time Transit Information Platform:** The project has set forth a vision for a user-friendly mobile app interface that will display real-time parking availability information. This app will be the primary means through which the public can access vital transit information. 
1. **Integration Approach**: A key aspect of Phase 1 is defining the integration approach. The project will employ Raspberry Pi as a central hub to collect data from the IoT sensors and update the mobile app promptly. 

**Design Thinking:** 

Design thinking is a pivotal methodology that will guide our project throughout its various phases. In Phase 1, we have laid the groundwork for applying design thinking principles to our project. These principles include: 

1. **Empathy**: To truly understand the needs of our users, we have engaged in empathetic research. We've interacted with potential users of the real-time transit information system, gaining insights into their pain points and preferences. This empathetic approach ensures that the end product aligns with the users' needs. 
1. **Ideation:** We've encouraged creative brainstorming sessions to generate innovative ideas for the IoT sensor system, mobile app interface, and parking guidance features. This ideation phase fosters creativity and ensures that our solutions address real-world challenges effectively. 
1. **Prototyping:** Prototyping allows us to visualize and test our ideas before full-scale implementation. In Phase 1, we've started to conceptualize prototypes for both the IoT sensor deployment and the mobile app interface. These prototypes will undergo refinement in subsequent phases based on user feedback. 
1. Testing: While not fully implemented in Phase 1, we've outlined a testing strategy that will be a critical component of design thinking. Rigorous testing ensures that the final product meets quality standards and is user-friendly. 

**Conclusion:** 

Phase 1 has served as a solid foundation for our ambitious project. We've clearly defined our objectives, planned the IoT sensor system's design, and envisioned the real-time transit information platform. The integration approach involving Raspberry Pi has been established. 

Design thinking will remain central to our project's development. As we progress into subsequent phases, we will continue to embrace empathy, ideation, prototyping, and testing. These principles will guide us in creating a public transportation solution that not only meets the project objectives but also exceeds user expectations. 

Phase 1 marks the beginning of a transformative journey to enhance public transportation services, and it sets a clear roadmap for the project's future success.
